0.475785 Nm torque motor

Half of ball thing is 0.45 kg
Half of lift is 0.94 kg
Total weight is 1.885 kg
Force it exerts downwards is 18.5 N

T = Q * R
Q is motor torque
T is torque of final axle
R is gearing ratio
R = 0.52

Q * R = r * F
F is required force to lift the lift (force the lift exerts down)
F = 18.5 N
r = Q * R / F
r = 0.013361 m

We'll probably do a 1-to-1

Hah that didn't work

0.475785 Nm torque motor

Half of ball thing is 0.45 kg
Half of lift is 0.76 kg
Total weight is 1.21
Force it exerts downwards is 11.8701 N

T = Q * R
Q is motor torque
T is torque of final axle
R is gearing ratio
R = 1/3

Q * R = r * F
F is required force to lift the lift (force the lift exerts down)
F = 11.8701 N
r = Q * R / F
r = 0.013361 m

12 mm is our spool size with a 1 to 3 gearing ratio.
